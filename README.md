"Teenagers Time Management" is a crucial aspect of our Power BI project, designed to empower young individuals with effective time management skills. In an era of constant digital distractions and increasing academic, extracurricular, and social commitments, teenagers often struggle to balance their time efficiently. Our project aims to provide insightful data-driven solutions that help teenagers make informed decisions about how they allocate their time. By analyzing data on their daily routines, commitments, and activities, we aim to offer valuable insights and actionable recommendations. With "Teenagers Time Management," we strive to equip teenagers with the tools they need to optimize their schedules, enhance productivity, and achieve a healthier work-life balance.
